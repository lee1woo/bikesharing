# Bike Sharing Analysis for Citi-Bike

## Overview of Statistical Analysis:

### Proposal

- In order to convince investors to implement a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, we prepared a bike trip analysis. This analysis included the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders, broken down by gender; the number of bike trips for all riders for every hour within the week, also broken down by gender; and the number of bike trips for each type of user (subscribers vs. non-subscribers), broken down by gender, for each day of the week. 

### Purpose

- To convince these stakeholders, we analyzed New York City's Citi-Bike data to launch a similar program with success in Des Moines. In addition to the components mentioned above, we provided information, including average trip duration by age as well as average use by hour in the busiest month of the calendar year, August. By scaling the data to Des Moines' needs, the investors should be convinced that this is a solid business opportunity to be taken advantage of.
